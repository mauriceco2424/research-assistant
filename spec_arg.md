Introduce Paper Discovery (Spec 09) aligned with master_spec.md §10 and constitutional P1-P10. Chat-first flow where the AI proposes candidate papers (metadata only) based on Base context or user query; the user reviews and explicitly approves selected items per batch, then the app performs metadata/PDF acquisition with logged consent. Requirements: no hidden network calls; prompt manifests for any remote model use; acquisitions recorded as orchestration events with approvals; failures become metadata-only NEEDS_PDF entries; storage remains local-first and regenerable via AI-layer records. User can request discovery by topic, gap-filling from KnowledgeProfile weaknesses, or follow-ups from recent sessions. Success criteria: (1) user can request and receive a candidate list in chat; (2) per-batch approval precedes any fetch, with clear actions (metadata vs PDF); (3) approved items are added to the Base with provenance and consent logged; (4) unsuccessful fetches are marked NEEDS_PDF with reasons; (5) all artifacts and events are local and regenerable from AI-layer data with zero hidden network calls.
