Implement: Chat intent planning artifacts (Spec 006)

**Specification & Plan**
- Documented failure short-circuit, remote-disable enforcement, and clarified acceptance criteria within spec and plan.
- Captured architectural context (Rust + Tauri, developer docs) and corrected performance targets in the implementation plan.

**Research & Design Docs**
- Added Phase 0 research decisions, entity data model, API contracts, and quickstart validation steps tailored to the assistant router.
- Recorded checklist compliance to ensure spec quality before planning.

**Execution Plan (tasks.md)**
- Structured tasks by phases/user stories, including remote-toggle guard, failure cancellation tests, base-guarding, suggestion engine, and polish benchmarks/docs.
- Aligned tasks with constitutional requirements and clarified independent tests per story.
